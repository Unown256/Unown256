        <p>The site has a blog now!</p>
        <p>I'm gonna post updates on my games and other projects here, primarily just to catalogue everything I do.</p>
        <p>There's been nothing new on my itch.io page for a while, but I have a couple projects in the work both personally and with Swordfish. Keep an eye out here to see if any of them actually release!</p>
        <p>Hopefully, I'll be announcing at least something here on the blog soon, but it depends how progress goes.</p>
