        <p>I released a new game recently!</p>
        <a href="https://lotusfish.itch.io/captcha3k"> (Check it out here) </a>
        <p>I made this over the course of about a day, give or take half an hour the day before. Spiritually it's a jam game, given the amount of time I put into it, but it wasn't really made for a jam.</p>
        <p>It's a short little highscore game where you have to solve small easy tasks as they slide onto your desk at increasing speeds. Nothing all too special, but I think it's fun! </p>
        <p>I really just made it because I had the idea of small little slips with basic maths equations sliding onto the desk, realised I could make it quite easily. Then I did. </p>
        <p> Anyway, that's all really. Hopefully it won't be another year before I make something else new :P </p>
